  subtitle: 'Compare NFA-regulated brokers with USD accounts and competitive trading conditions',
  introduction: 'The United States has one of the most strictly regulated forex markets in the world, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and National Futures Association (NFA). US traders benefit from some of the strongest investor protections globally.\n\nThe US forex market is characterized by stringent regulatory requirements, including high capital requirements for brokers and strict leverage limits. While this results in fewer broker options, it ensures excellent security and protection for US traders.\n\nUS-based forex brokers must maintain substantial capital reserves, follow strict compliance procedures, and provide transparent trading conditions to American traders.',
