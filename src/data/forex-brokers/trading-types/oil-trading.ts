The crude oil market offers excellent liquidity and volatility, making it attractive for traders seeking diversification beyond traditional currency pairs.\n\nThe two primary benchmarks for crude oil are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for North America and North Sea Brent for the global market. Most competitive brokers offer oil CFD trading with leverage up to 1:100, though this varies by jurisdiction. Oil prices are influenced by supply and demand dynamics, OPEC decisions, geopolitical events, and economic data.\n\nFor US traders, CFD trading is not available due to SEC regulations, so they typically trade oil futures or ETFs instead. International traders can access oil CFDs, which provide exposure to price movements without owning the underlying asset.', lastUpdated: 'August 25, 2025', features: [ { title: 'Oil Trading
