## 🔐 Admin Credentials

- **Password**: Bibi&2017!!
- **Role**: super_admin
- **Permissions**: Full access to all admin features

## 📋 Final Setup Steps

To complete the setup, you need to set the user's public metadata in Clerk (this must be done server-side):

### Step 1: Get Your Clerk Secret Key
1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
3. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

### Step 2: Get the User ID
1. In Clerk Dashboard, go to Users
2. Find the user with email `vivaluxo37@gmail.com`
3. Copy the **User ID** (starts with `user_`)

### Step 3: Set Public Metadata
Run this cURL command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.clerk.com/v1/users/USER_ID_HERE/metadata" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "public_metadata": {
      "role": "super_admin",
      "isSuperAdmin": true
    }
  }'
```

Replace:
- `USER_ID_HERE` with the actual User ID
- `YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY` with your actual Clerk secret key
